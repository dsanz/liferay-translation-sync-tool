Steps:

0.    Reorganize code to prepare the change.
  0.1 [ok] get rid of unused stuff: backporter standalone, etc.
  0.2 [ok] move actions to actions folder
  0.3 [ok] Reorganize API folder

1.     Check that export pootle files works even if template file is outdated (e.g. NAS outage)

2.     Implement new actions from exiting apis
 2.1 [ok] Merge several projects taken from pootle into a new one (basic impl)
 2.2      new src2pootle reusing the existing one
 2.3      new pootle2src based on the spread within the same repo (use a new spread action based on the first one)
 2.4      new provisioner.add operation, this time taking a new repo
