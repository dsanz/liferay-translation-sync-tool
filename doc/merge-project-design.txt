Steps:

0.    Reorganize code to prepare the change.
  0.1 [ok] get rid of unused stuff: backporter standalone, etc.
  0.2 [ok] move actions to actions folder
  0.3 [ok] Reorganize API folder

1. [ok]  Check that export pootle files works even if template file is outdated (e.g. NAS outage)

2.     Implement new actions from exiting apis
 2.1 [ok] Merge several projects taken from pootle into a new one (basic impl)
 2.2 [ok] new src2pootle reusing the existing one
 2.3 [ok] improve template export in pootle, in case it's not properly updated in the DB
 2.4 [ok] improve template import in pootle, making sure it gets updated from the templates
 2.5 [ok] check error in merge for some keys like activity-details. Maybe update from templates is wrong.
 2.5      new pootle2src based on the spread within the same repo (use a new spread action based on the first one)
 2.6      new provisioner.add operation, this time taking a new repo
 2.7      (optional) make a sql-based translation publisher

 Go-live plan
 ---------------

 1. For each repo, rename the biggest project to make it repo-based counterpart
 2. Merge all existing pootle projects into them
 3. Check results
 4. Delete old, per-module projects (use provisioner if possible)
 5. sync to pootle
 6. sync to sources
