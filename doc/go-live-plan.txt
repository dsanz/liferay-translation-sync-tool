Dev tests
----------

1. Rename project code portal --> portal-impl
	Required the project auto-provisioning uses the directory name to link projects in pootle with sources.

2. Make sure AP is finished
	2.1 All portal projects know its ant build-lang path
	2.2 Test for one AP project that it can be synced (e.g. use of correct arrays in the code, build-lang)
	2.3 Review the resulting pr

3. Translation splitting (core to modules)
	3.1 Analyze & implement required changes in the backporter
	3.2 Test single backport. Check translation status for the module before and after
	3.3 Create script to backport to all modules
	3.4 Test final result. Don't commit

4. Review install-assets.sh and remote-control-api for dev and prod

5. clen opt/ dir. Run install-assets.sh

6. Test all projects creation from AP. Make sure portal-impl is _NOT_ created as it was renamed.

7. Install openssh/ftp server (or the like) and check that production machine can copy data to dev


Production (only after all dev stuff is done)
----------

1. Tell Brandon. Make sure he can set pootle prod to maintenance page
2. Create a backup from sync-tool and copy in dev machine
2. Clean old stuff in opt/. Leave some recent logs and backups
3. Run install-assets.sh in production. Check it works
4. Translation sync-tool: pull origin master (or tag)
5. Rename project code portal --> portal-impl
6. Create a backup (2) from sync-tool and copy in dev machine
7. Enable maintenance page for pootle
8. Run the backporter from latest sources + all portal-impl translations, commit and wait for approval
9. Enable back pootle server
10. Run AP for all projects. Check results (specially for modules)
11. Announce the new projects
